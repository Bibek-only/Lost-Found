## 📌 Project Overview
Lost & Found is a web application designed to help students and faculty recover lost items on campus quickly and efficiently.  
The platform enables users to report **lost belongings**, post **found items** with details (location, time, and images), and receive instant notifications when a possible match is detected.

The primary goal is to **reduce frustration, save time, and build a supportive campus community** by connecting people who have lost or found items.
